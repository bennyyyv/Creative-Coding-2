TinkerCad's circuit and code blocks are a really easy way to learn and become familiar with
circuits and simple code. In high school I had to take a class that involved 3D modeling and
printing and circuits and I think we used a really old version of Autodesk Inventor and it was
super hard to learn and there were so many weird features and no tutorials because it assumed
you were a professional and not a student. If we would've had TinkerCad it would've been so much
easier to learn how to model things on a computer. TinkerCad also makes circuits really easy
because it shows you what's wrong and does a lot of the calculating for you. I remember having
to break out the calculator quite a bit when figuring out what resistor to use and TinkerCad
takes a lot of that tedious work and does it for you. I think we did something with code blocks
either in this class or in Creative Coding I but TinkerCad's code blocks allow for a lot of
creativity and there are a lot of options for you to combine code and circuits and other elements
together to create a working project.
